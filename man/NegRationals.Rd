\title{Set of Negative Rationals}
\description{
The mathematical set of negative rational numbers.
}
\details{
The set of Positive Rationals is defined as the set of numbers that can be written as a fraction
of two integers and are non-negative, i.e.
\deqn{NegRationals = \{\frac{p}{q} | p,q \ \in \ Z, \ \frac{p}{q} \le 0\}}{NegRationals = {p/q | p,q \epsilon Z, p/q \le 0}}
where \eqn{Z} is the set of integers.

\eqn{0} may or may not be included (depending on the \code{zero} argument).
