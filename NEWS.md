* Fixed bug in Matdist where d/p/q/r were transposed incorrectly
* Fixed bug in

# distr6 1.6.9

* M1mac fix

# distr6 1.6.8

* Added `Matdist` to simplify the process of creating a vector distribution for `WeightedDiscrete` distributions. `Matdist` acts as a univariate distribution whilst technically being multivariate - it contains a matrix of probabilities and provides methods for acting on those.
* Added methods: `plot.Matdist` to wrap `matplot` around `Matdist`, `c.Matdist` to combine multiple matrix distributions into one, `[.Matdist` for extracting `WeightedDiscrete` or `Matdist` distributions from `Matdist`, and `as.Distribution`.
* Added `mixMatrix` as a specialised mixing method for `Matdist` that creates a new `Matdist` instead of a `MixtureDistribution`
* Possibly breaking change - Changed default of `as.Distribution.matrix` to now coerce to a `Matdist`, a vector of `WeightedDisrete` is still possible.
* Slight speed improvements to EmpiricalMV
* Fixed r-devel linux warnings

# distr6 1.6.7

* Fix for Apple M1

# distr6 1.6.6

* WeightedDiscrete now correctly handles improper distributions by returning Inf and NA where appropriate

* Parameter set interface has been moved to [param6](https://cran.r-project.org/package=param6). This should not cause breakages if parameters have only been accessed via distribution methods but may otherwise.
* R62S3 is no longer loaded by default, S3 methods must now be manually created with R62S3::R62Fun. This may cause breakages if scripts assume pre-loading but will work as before once R62Fun is called (see S3 and piping vignette)

* Fixed bug in extracting distributions from vector distributions

# distr6 1.5.1

* Added `ids` active binding to more easily get ids of distributions in `VectorDistribution`

# distr6 1.5.0

### Minor Updates

#### Added Functionality

* Added `length.VectorDistribution`
* Added `ids` parameter to `VectorDistribution` to allow specifying names for wrapped distributions. Extended `extract.VectorDistribution` so these ids can be used for extraction.
* Added sugar function `dstr` to construct distributions more easily, e.g. `dstr("Binom", size = 4)` instead of `Binomial$new(size = 4)`.
* Added sugar function `dstrs` to construct a `VectorDistribution` of distributions.
* `ParameterSet` method `setParameterValue` now includes `resolveConflicts` parameter for resolving conflicts between conflicting parameters (see below). This should primarily only be used internally and is useful for transforming composite distributions.

#### Edited Functionality

* The separator for composite (wrapped) distributions is now `__` (before `_`). This may affect backwards compatibility in rare cases.
* Construction and setting of parameters is now changed. Previously this relied on knowing a confusing hierarchy in parameters which would take priority over one another. Now if conflicting parameters are supplied in construction or on setting an error is returned, e.g. `Binomial$new(prob = 0.1, qprob = 0.2)` would cause an error. This may affect bacwards compatibility however should not do so if distributions are correctly constructed/updated without conflicts.
* `setParameterValue` in `ParameterSet` no longer errors if a non-settable parameter is updated, instead a `warning` is given and the parameter is ignored.
* Multivariate distributions no longer error if constructed with a single variate, though this is still advised against.
* Internal changes to how `SDistribution` parameter defaults are set. Previously these were set in the constructor with function defaults, now they are set in the `ParameterSet`. This should not affect backwards compatibility. This should improve speed of distribution construction.

#### Deprecated/Removed Functionality

* Data parameter in `WeightedDiscrete` distribution has now been removed.

### Bug fixes/Under the Hood Edits

* Minor bug fixes in some distribution properties.
* `MixtureDistribution` now uses `extraDistr::rmnom` for speed improvements.
* Slight improvement to error messages in `ParameterSet` but these will be improved further in a future update.
* Minor internal changes to storage method of `SDistribution` `ParameterSet` objects.
* Fixed typos in parameter sets

## Minor Updates

### Added/Edited Functionality

* Multivariate functions in `VectorDistribution` now return arrays
* Analytical `median` now available for `SDistribution`s where closed form expressions are known
* Kernels now implemented in `Rcpp` with analytical log-pdf expressions. Analytical lower.tail and log.p will come in future versions.
* Adding plotting for bivariate distributions using `{plotly}`
* Added `EmpiricalMV` for empirical multivariate distributions
* All documentation now uses roxygen R6
* Distribution `type` is now required in construction custom `Distribution`s as the previous method of 'guessing' was inefficient.
* Added `ParameterSetCollection` for `Wrapper`s. Same functionality as before but much more efficient.
* Added `$addDeps` and `$deps` to `ParameterSet`s to replace `updateFunc`. This allows faster and more precise control over parameter updates.
* Added `$addChecks` and `$checks` to `ParameterSet`s to replace custom checks in distributions, and  `$addTrafos` and `$trafos` to replace custom parameter transformations before setting. These allows clearner control over parameter setting.
* `categories` parameter in `Categorical` now called `nCategories`
* Constructor of `Categorical` now requires elements to be provided as a `list` to `elements`
* `settable` in `ParameterSet` now refers to the more intuitive flag that describes if a parameter can be set after construction
* Added `length` active binding to `ParameterSet` to return number of parameters in the set.
* Renamed `squared2Norm` in `Kernel`s to `pdfSquared2Norm` and added `x` to arguments to allow for shifted norms.
* Added `mixturiseVector` for mixing vector distributions

### Deprecated Functions/Fields/Methods

* Individual property and trait accessors deprecated: `$support, $symmetry, $kurtosisType, $skewnessType, $valueSupport, $variateForm, $type`
* Separated `Loglogistic` and `ShiftedLoglogistic` so only the latter has a `location` parameter. Additionally added an analytical `rand` expression to `ShiftedLoglogistic`, and `Loglogistic` now implemented from package `actuar`
* Removed deprecated classes: `ArrayDistribution`
* Removed deprecated functions: `listSpecialSets`
* `WeighedDiscrete` distribution now stores samples and probabilities as parameters.
* Removed `verbose` argument from distribution constructor
* Public `update` method in `ParameterSet` moved to `private`
* Removed `squared2Norm` from the `ExoticStatistics` decorator
* Deprecated `updateFunc` from `ParameterSet`
* Removed `.getRefParams` from `SDistribution`s and added `deps`

## Patches

* Bugfix in `decorate` function that was overwriting the `decorators` private field instead of appending
* Vastly improved speed of construction of `SDistribution` and `Kernel`
* Bugfix in `$rand` for `Geometric` distribution with `trials == TRUE` , previously was randomising between $[1, Inf)$ not $[0, Inf)$
* Changed default `form` parameter in `NegativeBinomial`, now errors if supplied argument is not in one of the four choices (previously reverted to "fbs")
* Fixed bug in `MultivariateNormal` `rand()` which was not adding the `mean` correctly
* Massive bottleneck in `VectorDistribution` for same distribution type removed in d/p/q/r functions as well as non-generating function methods
* Improved speed in `VectorDistribution` when only one row or column of data passed to d/p/q
* `Dirichlet, DiscreteUniform, Frechet Gumbel, Pareto, Rayleigh, Triangular, Wald` now implemented from package `extraDistr`
* Bug fix in `Frechet` `$cdf`
* Analytical `log` and `lower.tail` now available for all `SDistributions` and imputation possible for customs with `CoreStatistics`
* `NegativeBinomial` now uses Rcpp for d/p/q/r
* Distributions from `stats` are now vectorised across parameters in C
* `Degenerate`, `ShiftedLoglogistic` now Rcpp
* Removed redundant `K` parameter from `MultivariateNormal`
* Bugfix in `Wald`, symmetry was incorrectly flagged as "symmetric"
* Fixed bug in `TruncatedDistribution` support - previously support interval type was `"[]"` instead of `"(]"`. An important implication is that even if truncating at or outside of the distribution limits, the support will still be changed if the distribution was left-closed to become left-open.
* Improved speed of assertions by using package `{checkmate}`
* Bugfix in `listDistributions` which was overriding filtering with `simplify`

# distr6 1.3.7

* Minor internal Updates
* Next release will be 1.4.0, due to nature of R6 this will break dependencies.


# distr6 1.3.6

* Bugfix in `decorate` function that was overwriting the `decorators` private field instead of appending
* Added `plot.VectorDistribution` for more efficient plotting of mutiple distributions at the same time
* Two bug fixes in `MultivariateNormal$rand()` . i) the distribution mean wasn't being added to the transformation correctly; ii) the Choleskey decomposition wasn't transposed causing incorrect simulations

# distr6 1.3.5

* Added Erlang distribution
* Fixed mistake in documentation for `Weibull`, thanks to Paul Northrop (@paulnorthrop) for pointing this out.
* Fixed bug in `plot` preventing only `quantile` being plotted on its own
* Converted descriptive public methods to active bindings. Unfortunately this will break reverse dependencies as there's no way to soft deprecate these. Affected methods are:  `decorators, traits, valueSupport, variateForm, type, properties, support, symmetry, sup, inf, dmax, dmin, kurtosisType, skewnessType`

# distr6 1.3.4

- Bug fix in `VectorDistribution` that was causing decorators not to be added properly
- Bug fix in `VectorDistribution` that was causing an error when extracting decorated wrapped distributions
- Moved package `pracma` to suggests. Removed `utils` dependency.
- Added checks to assert all packages are installed when required by distributions
- Deprecated `package` field in distributions, now called `packages`
- `packages` lists all packages required to be installed for a distribution, if `NULL` only distr6 required
- Abstracted SetInterval and related classes to the `set6` package
- Deprecated `listSpecialSets`, use `set6::listSpecialSets` instead
- Removed secondary checks on `update` of `ParameterSet` , any properly defined distributions will have this covered in primary parameter, thus increasing speed.

# distr6 1.3.3

- `as.data.table` has been moved from a `ParameterSet` method to an S3 dispatch. Fixes an important bug of overloading `as.data.table` but may affect backwards compatibility.
- Added `distrSimulate` for convenient simulation from any distribution
- Updated `plot` to be able to handle distributions without `quantile` or `rand`. Optimised runtime by preventing automatic computation of `pdf` and `cdf`.

# distr6 1.3.2

- Bug fix in `VectorDistribution` - missing `which` argument
- Bug fix in `Bernoulli` - `rand` was incorrectly calling `dbinom` not `rbinom`
- Bug fix in the `mode` of distributions
- Added `mode` to documentation

# distr6 1.3.1

- Added wrapper for VectorDistribution for quick concatenation of constructed distributions, `c.Distribution`
- `VectorDistribution` `print` method more in line with base R vectors

# distr6 1.3.0

## Minor Updates

### Added Functions and Classes

- `plot` function for plotting the `pdf, cdf, survival, quantile, hazard, cumhazard` or `distr6` objects
- `lines` function for superimposing `distr6` plots
- `qqplot` function for comparing `distr6` distributions to each other or to other theoretical distributions
- Added `Extract.VectorDistribution` for extracted distributions from inside a `VectorDistribution`, see the big update below.

### Updated Functions

- `decorate` now allows users to specify the Decorator as a character as well as supplying the object, this makes it simpler when using distr6 whilst unattached
- **Big changes** (and hopefully final) to the `VectorDistribution`. Now the `VectorDistribution` only constructs the internal wrapped distributions when they are extracted or when a function, such as d/p/q/r, are called. This massively reduces a bottleneck in constructing the distribution. Additionally added functions for extracting distributions from inside the `VectorDistribution`. The only difference that should affect backwards compatibility is that the `distribution` argument must now be a character and not an object. Custom (i.e. non-`SDistribution`) distributions should be used in conjunction with the `distlist` initializer.
- Changed the lower bound of positive Sets to .Machine$double.xmin as the previous value of 1.1e-15 was too restrictive
- Added `skewness`, `kurtosis`, `entropy`, `mgf`, `cf`, and `pgf` to `WeightedDiscrete` and `Empirical`
- Added support for custom distributions in `VectorDistribution` and for `CoreStatistics` functions as well as support for only one arguments passed to d/p/q/r for fast comparisons between wrapped distributions

## Patches

- Bug fix in `WeightedDiscrete` distribution `variance` calculation
- Fixed bug in `Empirical` that was stopping the cdf of the first point in the distribution being evaluated
- Fixed bug that allowed invalid parameter values to be set for non-reference parameters
- Updated parameter error messages to be more informative
- Improved speed and efficiency in `Distribution` constructor for wrappers

# distr6 1.2.0

## Minor Updates

### Added Functions and Classes

- Added non-central F, T, Chi-Squared, and Beta distributions
- Added WeightedDiscrete distribution. This allows users to supply a data.frame of samples and pdf/cdfs for more efficient usage with empirical discrete estimators (e.g. Kaplan-Meier)

### Updated Functions

- Added the common survival parameterisation of Weibull distribution
- Updated the listX functions to make them quicker and functional when distr6 is not attached
- Added `suppressMoments` argument to `Distribution` constructor to allow for faster construction

## Patches

- Added `errormsg` argument to assertions so a custom error message can be provided
- Fixed error in quantile function in `Empirical` that was causing results to be dropped
- Fixed bug in `TruncatedDistribution` that prevented multivariate distributions being truncated
- Fixed error in variance of `Empirical` that was calculating sample not population
- Moved rare imports to suggests

# distr6 1.1.0

## Minor Updates

### Added Functions and Classes

- `Empirical` distribution for distributions arising from observed samples (e.g. from MC sampling methods)
- `simulateEmpiricalDistribution`: function for sampling *without* replacement from an `Empirical` distribution

### Deprecated Functions

- `ArrayDistribution` - This wrapper is now merged with `ProductDistribution` by adding two new parameters to `ProductDistribution` that allow for construction either by a distribution list of by naming a distribution and providing a parameter list or data.table

### Updated Functions

- Added quantile to Categorical distribution and updated its cdf efficiency
- `cdf` of discrete distributions evaluated between integers are now evaluated after rounding down and do not return 0, e.g. `Binomial$new()$cdf(1.8) == Binomial$new()$cdf(1)`
- Added two additional parameters to `ProductDistribution`: `params` and `distribution`, so that it can either function as before or as the `ArrayDistribution` wrapper which is now deprecated.
- Added two additional parameters to `VectorDistribution`: `params` and `distribution`, so that it can either function as before or as a generalisation to the `ArrayDistribution` wrapper which is now deprecated.
- Removed automated rounding of numerics when `ParameterSet` expected integer in `setParameterValue`
- Added parameter `n` to `strprint` and `print` to clean the print method for distributions (especially wrappers) with multiple parameters
- Added optional `vectordist` argument to `MixtureDistribution` for better compatibility with `VectorDistribution`
- Changed `short_name` of  Uniform, Logistic, Normal, and Triangular kernels to remove `Kern`. The `ClassName`s (and thus constructors) remain the same
- `listKernels` and `listSpecialSet` now return data.tables with `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`
- `Degenerate` distribution re-classified as discrete

## Patches

- Bug fix in quantile function of huberization wrapper
- Fixed the `rand` return of a Vector Distribution (transposed data.table and added column names)
- Fixed spelling mistakes in extension guidelines and removed calls to redundant parameters
- Removed redundant `crayon` dependency
- Fixed bug in `MixtureDistribution` that was causing `rand` to erroneously return integers
- Removed error in `Categorical` documentation
